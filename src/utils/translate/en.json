      }
    },
    "Question2": {
      "Question": "How does SeroTracker collect their data?",
      "Answer": "We conduct regular searches of several databases including Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Europe PMC and targeted google searches. In addition, anyone can submit sources for us to screen and include in our review using the \"Submit source\" button above."
    },
    "Question3": {
      "Question": "How does SeroTracker extract data from their sources?",
      "Answer": "We have an extensive research team trained in health sciences and epidemiology who manually reviews articles and records seroprevalence estimates into a data management platform called AirTable. The processes and rules we follow to extract data are available in our study protocol document and AirTable data dictionary."
    },
    "Question4": {
      "Question": "How often is SeroTracker Data Updated?",
      "Answer": "SeroTracker data is updated approximately every week. Our team scans new literature every Friday and data is added over the course of the following week."
    },
    "Question5": {
      "Question": "How does SeroTracker’s data show up on the map?",
      "Answer": "Data inputted into Airtable is automatically run through a software pipeline that cleans it and computes additional information (e.g. a study’s geographic coordinates). The outputs of the pipeline are then stored in a separate database, which is queried by serotracker.com to serve the \"Explore\" tab."
    },
    "Question6": {
      "Question": "Can I download SeroTracker's data for my own analysis?",
      "Answer": "Yes, our data is open-source and free for anyone to use. You can download our complete .csv file using the \"Download CSV\" button above. You will first be asked to fill out a form indicating your role, affiliation (if relevant), and type of research you’re conducting - This helps us create datasets that are most useful to you. "
